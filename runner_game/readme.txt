Runner game

To run:
1) Download the intro_to_pygame folder and its contents
2) Open your Command Prompt by typing "cmd" into the search bar and pressing enter
3) Navigate to where the folder was downloaded. You can use the "cd" command to change your directory (sometimes referred to as folders). If you type in a couple letters of the folder and then press the Tab key, it will show you the closest match. If it doesn't show up on the first try, then press Tab again to show the next result. Repeat this until you've found your target, and press the Enter key. NOTE: if you've taken the wrong path by mistake, you can type "cd .." and press Enter to return to the previous folder. The last "cd" command you'll make is "cd runner_game".
4) To run the game, type "main.py" into the console and press Enter

Alternatively, you can navigate to the folder using your mouse, and double-click on "main.py"
